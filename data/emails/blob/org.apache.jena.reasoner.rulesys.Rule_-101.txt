Greetings,

thank you for the email.

Given the class org.apache.jena.reasoner.rulesys.Rule that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
The implementation can be surely improved, starting from the rule definition.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
5

cheers,\nXXX
