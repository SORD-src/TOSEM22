Dear Mr. XXX,

I see the problem.

Given the class org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.tez.TezDagBuilder that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
Since this is a test, it is ok for us to have it a bit larger than other classes.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
1

Best regards,\nXXX
