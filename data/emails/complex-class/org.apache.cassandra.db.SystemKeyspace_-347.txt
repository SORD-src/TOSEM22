Dear XXX,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.apache.cassandra.db.SystemKeyspace that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
it may be refactored for comprehensibility, but it works and so there is no need now to do it. 

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

cheers,\nXXX
