Dear Mr. XXX,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.SSTableReader that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
this is something we were considering since the class is complex enough not to allow everybody to work on it. We will do that at some oiint.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

Cheers,\nXXX
