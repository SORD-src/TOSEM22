Greetings,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.apache.cayenne.access.translator.ejbql.EJBQLConditionTranslator that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
there are too many conditions covered, it needs to be found a way to simplify the class.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
4

Kind regards,\nXXX
