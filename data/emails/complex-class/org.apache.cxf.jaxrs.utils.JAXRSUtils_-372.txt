Greetings,

I see the point, thanks.

Given the class org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.utils.JAXRSUtils that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
thanks for your email. I see the problem of the class, but I can still apply changes to it so I do not need now to refactor.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
