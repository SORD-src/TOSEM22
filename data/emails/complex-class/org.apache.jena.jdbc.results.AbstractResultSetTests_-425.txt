Dear XXX,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.apache.jena.jdbc.results.AbstractResultSetTests that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
I see that an external notes that the design of the class could be improved (there are too many methods that do too many things), but I use to develop on this class and refactoring may be done at some point. 

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

cheers,\nXXX
