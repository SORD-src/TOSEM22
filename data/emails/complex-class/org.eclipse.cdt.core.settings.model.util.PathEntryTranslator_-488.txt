Dear Mr. XXX,

thank you for the email.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model.util.PathEntryTranslator that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the path translator can be simplified, but the class doe not change so much so there is no really need to refactor.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

Kind regards,\nXXX
