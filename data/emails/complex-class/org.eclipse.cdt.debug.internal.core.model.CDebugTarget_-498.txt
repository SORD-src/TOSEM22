Dear Mr. XXX,

I see the problem.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.debug.internal.core.model.CDebugTarget that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the class has been modified in the past and this made it complexâ€¦ but now it is stable enough.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

cheers,\nXXX
