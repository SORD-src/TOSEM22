Dear Mr. XXX,

thanks for pointing this out

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser.MemoryBrowser that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the class keeps track of the memory spent by the parser, it is old enough not to be touched frequently. 

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

Kind regards,\nXXX
