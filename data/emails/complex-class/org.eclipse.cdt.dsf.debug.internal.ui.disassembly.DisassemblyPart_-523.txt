Hi XXX,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.internal.ui.disassembly.DisassemblyPart that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
DisassemblyPart requires some refactoring because it has too many loops and if statements, yet it is now in a stable fashion.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

greetings,\nXXX
