I see the problem.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.ui.viewmodel.launch.StackFramesVMNode that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the class has some methods that look complex, but it is not really a problem.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
