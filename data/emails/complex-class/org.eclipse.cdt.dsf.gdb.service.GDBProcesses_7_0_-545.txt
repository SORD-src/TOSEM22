Dear XXX,

thank you for the email.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GDBProcesses_7_0 that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the processes work pretty well but they may seem poorly designed - they are complex to work on for newcomers. We have some changes to this class and refactor now would be a bit complicated.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

bye,
XXX
