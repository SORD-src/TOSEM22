Greetings,

thank you for the email.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.MIBreakpointsManager that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the class contains too many loops and this has the effect of making it hard to read. It is possible to improve its design tough

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

Cheers,\nXXX
