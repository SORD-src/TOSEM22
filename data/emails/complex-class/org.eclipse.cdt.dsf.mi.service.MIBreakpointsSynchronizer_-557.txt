Hello XXX,

I see the point, thanks.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.MIBreakpointsSynchronizer that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
don't believe the complexity is that high after all.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
