Dear Mr. XXX,

thank you for the e-mail.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.CommandFactory that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
factories are naturally harder to design and some action aimed at reducing their complexity migh be done.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
