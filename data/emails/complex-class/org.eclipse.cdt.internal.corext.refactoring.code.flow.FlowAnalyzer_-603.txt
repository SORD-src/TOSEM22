Greetings,

I see the point, thanks.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.internal.corext.refactoring.code.flow.FlowAnalyzer that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
it has too many loops, but is normal. It may be refactored, if really needed.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

Best regards,\nXXX
