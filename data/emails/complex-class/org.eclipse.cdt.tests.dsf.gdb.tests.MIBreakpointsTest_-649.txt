Greetings,

I see the problem.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb.tests.MIBreakpointsTest that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the test is complicated because the class it tests is complex as wellâ€¦ it is hard to refactor if the class is not refactored first.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

cheers,\nXXX
