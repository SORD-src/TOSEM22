Greetings,

thank you for the e-mail.

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests.text.CodeFormatterTest that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
to format elements, this class makes a number of loops. It might have been done differently, but stillâ€¦ 

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

cheers,\nXXX
