Hi,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.eclipse.cdt.ui.wizards.NewClassCreationWizardPage that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
this is a class that was created to replace the old way of doing a wizard page. Its still a bit too complex.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
