Hello XXX,

thank you for the e-mail.

Given the class org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.utils.JAXRSUtilsTest that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
perhaps, some methods could have been better designed so that they would not need to call external classes.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?

Best wishes,\nXXX
