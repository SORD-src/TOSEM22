Greetings,

thanks for pointing this out

Given the class org.apache.cxf.ws.rm.DestinationSequenceTest that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
that's hard to modify, since every time I change it several other classes may be impacted.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
3

Kind regards,\nXXX
