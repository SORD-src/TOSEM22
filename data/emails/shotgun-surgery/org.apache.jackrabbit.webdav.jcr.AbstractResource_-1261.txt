Hi XXX,

I see the point, thanks.

Given the class org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.jcr.AbstractResource that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
I'd say that the methods may be better organized.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
