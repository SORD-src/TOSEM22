Greetings,

I see the problem.

Given the class org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
the code is made complex, the class would need some refactoring to reduce the number of methods contained in it.

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
4

cheers,\nXXX
