Hello XXX,

thanks for reaching out!

Given the class org.apache.pig.newplan.logical.relational.LogicalSchema that you recently modified, I would kindly ask you to answer the following questions.

(1) Were you aware of the presence of a design flaw? (Please answer Yes/No)
Yes

(2) If yes to question (1), may you please briefly describe the type of design flaw affecting the class?
while some methods are a bit too complex, the main problem is that many classes are called from them. 

(3) If yes to question (1), may you please rate the criticality of the design flaw from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)?
